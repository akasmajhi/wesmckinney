# Introduction
This repository contains my notes and practice codes from the book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney. By far I have found this book to be extremely useful to understand Pandas library and data analysis in general.

Under this directory you will find the notes and src directory. 
- The notes directory contains the notes that I have taken from the book for
  each chapter. Each folder under the notes directory represent a chapter.
- The src directory contains the source code and possibly practice code related
  to the chapter represented by the folder name.
